# sqlalchemy-challenge
Marcus Assignment 10

My instructions were to plan a a trip and do a climate analysis on the area. 
I started by using Python and SQLAlchemy to do a climate analysis using a starter code that was provied. 
By creating an engine I was able to save my class(table) to my database.
I performed two analysis. One on precipitation and stations. I finished the project by creating a flask API.
